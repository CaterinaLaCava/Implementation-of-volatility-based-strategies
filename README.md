# Implementation of volatility-based strategies - Financial Big Data Project
## Group project written in Python 
Main tasks developed: 
\begin{itemize}:
\item Data preprocessing: the data consists of 4 years of tick-by-tick transaction prices on 87 US equity large stocks stored in 24.5 MG of data.
\item Asset clustering: use of 2 clustering algorithms to classify the assets into groups (say N groups).
\item Sub-portfolio formation: weight cluster components with a simple strategy to obtain N sub-portfolios. 
\item Implementation of volatility strategies: aggregate sub-portfolios in a unique portfolio assigning optimal sub-portfolio weights with known volatility strategies
\end{itemize}
