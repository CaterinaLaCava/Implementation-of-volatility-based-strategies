# Implementation of volatility-based strategies - Financial Big Data Project
## Group project written in Python 
Main tasks developed: 
- Data preprocessing: the data consists of 4 years of tick-by-tick transaction prices on 87 US equity large stocks stored in 24.5 MG of data.
- Asset clustering: use of 2 clustering algorithms to classify the assets into groups (say N groups).
- Sub-portfolio formation: weight cluster components with a simple strategy to obtain N sub-portfolios. 
- Implementation of volatility strategies: aggregate sub-portfolios in a unique portfolio assigning optimal sub-portfolio weights with known volatility strategies.
